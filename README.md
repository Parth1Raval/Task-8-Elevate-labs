üê≥ Deploying a Dockerized Python Web App to AWS ECS
This project demonstrates how to containerize a simple Python Flask web application using Docker and deploy it to the cloud with AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and AWS Fargate. The goal is to understand cloud-native deployment and make modern apps portable, scalable, and easy to launch anywhere.

üöÄ What I Did
Built a Simple Web App: Created a minimal Flask app that returns a greeting at the root URL.

Containerized the Application: Wrote a Dockerfile to package the app and its dependencies into a portable Docker image.

Tested Locally: Verified the Docker image runs as expected on my local machine.

Pushed to AWS ECR: Uploaded the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for secure, cloud-hosted storage.

Designed Cloud Networking: Manually set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnet, internet gateway, and route table to support deployment.

Deployed on AWS ECS (Fargate): Launched the Docker container as a managed service on ECS with public internet access.

Verified Deployment: Successfully accessed my cloud app in a browser using the assigned public IP on port 8080.

üìù What the Container Does
The container runs a lightweight Python Flask web server that listens on port 8080 and serves a simple greeting when accessed. You can visit the URL or public IP of the deployed AWS ECS task and see the message:

"Hello from my Dockerized Cloud App!"
